Enhanced Stimulus Syntax 10/04/00

The Maggie STIMULUS LIST controls both experiment sequencing and what subjects see.
It is a text file that can be loaded and stored as part of experiment configuration.
Within a -.LST file blank lines are ignored and everything subsequent to the "!"
character on a line is ignored as a comment (exception:  see escape sequences below).

In general each line of the stimulus list defines an experiment TOKEN (a specific trial
for which data is collected).  For clarity the "\+" escape sequence can be used to break
long lines; however lines concatenated in this way are still treated internally as single 
units.  The expected syntax is as follows:

  NAME (\dDURATION) (LABEL) (\eENHANCED_TEXT)

The first white-space delimited sequence of characters on this line is interpreted as 
the token NAME, and is used by Maggie to generate the filename of the acquired data 
for the trial.  This is the only required element.  It is optionally followed by a 
DURATION setting that resets the current trial acquisition period (if unspecified the 
current setting is used).  The duration must be introduced by the "\d" sequence, and
specified as an integer interpreted as seconds (e.g. \d8 sets token duration to 8 secs).
Following this is an optional token LABEL.  The label is displayed in the control window 
as a mnemonic for the experimenter, and if no enhanced text follows is also shown to the 
subject centered within the stimulus window.  For more precise control of the displayed
stimulus an ENHANCED_TEXT sequence should be appended.  This is introduced by the "\e" 
sequence; embedded <TAGS> control how subsequent text is displayed.

There are two special values for NAME which do not trigger acquisition, but which otherwise
work exactly the same (display extended text, set parameters, etc.):

  PAUSE	- this halts auto-sequencing if enabled and must be manually aborted
  DUMMY	- this functions exactly as a trial, but without acquiring data


Escape sequences (backslash followed by escaped character)

\\   explicit "\" character
\!   explicit "!" character
\+   continuation line follows
\dNN duration sequence
\e   enhanced text follows
\a, \n, \s  used to arm and set CI box attenuation levels

Enhanced text TAGS (PROPERTY embedded in "<>" delimiters)

<LT>			explicit "<" character

These tags function in pairs:  <PROPERTY> sets, </PROPERTY> cancels
<BOLD>			toggle bolding
<ITALIC>		toggle italicizing
<ULINE>			toggle underlining
<HCEN>			horizontal text centering
<VCEN>			vertical text centering
<CENTER>		window centered text

These tags take arguments
<P(=nn)>		carriage return (argument optional; default=1)
<ROW=nn>		set line number (negative values counted from bottom)
<COL=nn>		set column (negative values counted from right)
<FONT="fontname">	set specified font
<SIZE=nn>		set font size
<FGCOLOR=rrggbb>	set specified foreground color (00 - FF; red, green, blue)
<BGCOLOR=rrggbb>	set background color
<TXTCOLOR=rrggbb>	set text color
<MATRIX=ROWSxCOLS>	specify matrix
<IMAGE="filename">	display specified -.BMP format image file
<WAV="filename">	play specified -.WAV format sound file


Matrix specification syntax

The argument to the MATRIX tag gives its size (number of rows by columns).
The only text following this on a line should be the contents of the matrix;
i.e., place any text modification tags before the MATRIX tag.  Matrix contents
consist of cells separated by the "|" character, and the number of cells must
equal the product of the number of rows and columns.  Cells are parsed row-wise.
The first row of cells are interpreted as the column labels.  Cells on subsequent
rows are assumed to have two entries separated by a "," delimiter; these are 
displayed on top of each other centered within each cell grid.  Note that white
space within cell entries is both read and displayed.  Do not neglect to terminate
the final cell entry with the "|" separator (or the program will complain).


Notes

The centering tags must occur in pairs and may not be overlapped.  Any change
to text characteristics (FONT, SIZE, etc.) persists until changed again.  The
upper left corner of the displayed window is row 1 column 1, and this is the
default starting location for enhanced text.  Specifying negative values for
the ROW or COL tags resets the current text location to that number of lines
or columns counted from the current window bottom or right side respectively
(e.g. <ROW=-1> sets the current row to the bottom displayed line).  BMP image
files are loaded from the current working directory unless the filename includes
an explicit path.  Displayed images are stretched to fill the entire stimulus
window.  See the file TEST.LST for examples of all tags in action.
